# 💬 Sentiment Analysis Web App

A full-stack **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** project that analyzes the emotional tone of user text input.  
This web app showcases how text can be turned into meaningful emotional insights using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters text into the input area.  
2. The text is analyzed by the **Sentiment** NLP library, which assigns sentiment scores (+, –, or 0).  
3. A sentiment description (“Positive Vibes 😊”, “Neutral”, or “Negative 😔”) appears instantly.  
4. The analyzed data (text, score, comparative) is sent to the backend and stored in MongoDB.

## 📈 Example Results

| Input Text | Score | Comparative | Result |
|-------------|--------|--------------|---------|
| I love learning new technologies! | +3 | +1.0 | Positive 😊 |
| This movie was terrible. | -2 | -0.5 | Negative 😔 |
| It’s okay, nothing special. | 0 | 0.0 | Neutral 😐 |
